      <section className="legal-doc mt-6">
        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>
          These terms set out the conditions for using CatchWords (the iPhone app and the web
          version; “the Service”), provided by {name} (“the operator”). By using the Service you are
          deemed to have agreed to these terms. This is a translation; if it differs from the
          Japanese version, the Japanese version prevails.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for creating your account with accurate information and for keeping
          your credentials secure. The Service is not available to anyone under 13 years of age. If
          you are under 18, get your parent's or guardian's consent before using the Service or
          buying the paid plan. You can delete your account and leave at any time from “Delete
          account” in Settings.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Your content</h2>
        <p>
          You retain copyright in the photos, text and other content you add. You grant the operator
          the right to use that content to the extent necessary to provide and improve the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Prohibited conduct</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Infringing others' rights (portrait rights, copyright and so on), including
            photographing or adding people without their permission
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding obscene, violent or discriminatory content, or content sexualising children
          </li>
          <li>Misusing location data, including stalking</li>
          <li>
            Interfering with the operation of the Service, including unauthorised access and
            automated mass use
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting around usage limits, instructing the AI to behave in unintended ways, or
            selling, redistributing or using the Service or its AI-generated content to develop
            other AI services without permission
          </li>
          <li>Impersonating others</li>
          <li>Fraudulent use of payments</li>
          <li>Anything illegal or contrary to public order and morals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you break these terms, the operator may remove your content, suspend your use of the
          Service or delete your account. Except in an emergency, the operator will tell you in
          advance where possible.
        </p>

        <h2>5. AI-generated content</h2>
        <p>
          The Service uses AI to create meanings, readings, example sentences, explanations,
          quizzes, pronunciation audio, images and similar content. AI-generated content may contain
          errors, and the operator does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. Use it as a study
          aid, and check anything important against a dictionary or a qualified person. If you find
          an error, you can report it with “Report an error in this entry” on that word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not rely on the Service to decide whether food, plants, mushrooms, medicines and the
          like are safe, or for medical, health or allergy decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use AI features, photos and text are sent to the external providers listed in the
          Privacy Policy. The iPhone app asks for your consent to this before you first use an AI
          feature. If you do not consent, AI features are unavailable, but the rest of the Service
          still works.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Paid plan (subscription)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Service offers a paid subscription plan (“the paid plan”). The features included in
            the paid plan are shown on the purchase screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            The price, currency and billing period (monthly or yearly) are shown on the purchase
            screen and the checkout page before you subscribe. Payments are processed by Stripe.
          </li>
          <li>
            The paid plan renews automatically for the same period unless you cancel, and the
            payment method you registered is charged on each renewal date.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can cancel at any time from “CatchWords Pro” → “Manage subscription” in{" "}
            <a href="/settings">Settings</a>. After you cancel you will not be charged from the next
            renewal date, and you can use the paid plan until the end of the period you have already
            paid for. Deleting your account does not cancel the paid plan automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Except where required by law, fees already paid are not refunded (including pro-rata
            refunds when you cancel part-way through a period).
          </li>
          <li>
            If a payment cannot be confirmed at renewal, the paid plan's features may be suspended.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator may change the price or contents of the paid plan. Before changing the
            price, the operator will give reasonable advance notice in the Service or by email to
            your registered address, and the new price applies from the first renewal after the
            notice. If you do not agree, you can cancel before the next renewal date.
          </li>
          {info.trialDays > 0 && (
            <li>
              A free trial of {info.trialDays} days is included when you subscribe. If you do not
              cancel before the trial ends, the paid plan starts automatically when it ends and you
              are charged.
            </li>
          )}
          <li>
            The paid plan cannot be purchased inside the iPhone or Android app. Before purchases in
            the iPhone app (Apple in-app purchase) start, this section and the Legal notice will be
            revised and announced in the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the full conditions of sale, see the{" "}
            <a href="/legal/tokushoho">Legal notice (Specified Commercial Transactions Act)</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          Intellectual property in the Service — including its logo, design and the format of
          AI-generated cards — belongs to the operator or the rightful owners.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes and suspension</h2>
        <p>
          The operator may change or stop providing the Service. If the Service is to be
          discontinued while the paid plan is offered, the operator will give reasonable advance
          notice.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer and limitation of liability</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The operator does not warrant that the Service (including AI-generated content) is free
            of factual or legal defects.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator is not liable for damage you suffer from using the Service, except where
            caused by the operator's intent or gross negligence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, if the contract between the operator and you is
            a consumer contract under Japan's Consumer Contract Act, the previous paragraph does not
            apply. In that case, for damage caused to you by the operator's negligence (other than
            gross negligence) through breach of contract or tort, the operator is liable only for
            damage that would ordinarily arise, up to the amount you paid the operator for the
            Service in the month in which the damage occurred.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>10. Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>
          The operator may change these terms in accordance with the Civil Code of Japan. The
          operator will announce the changes and the date they take effect in the Service in
          advance.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of Japan.{" "}
          {info.jurisdictionCourt
            ? `Any dispute relating to the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ${info.jurisdictionCourt} as the court of first instance.`
            : "Any dispute relating to the Service shall be brought before the court that has jurisdiction under Japan's Code of Civil Procedure."}{" "}
          This does not take away the protection that mandatory consumer protection laws of your
          country of residence give you as a consumer.
        </p>

        <h2>12. The iPhone app obtained from the App Store</h2>
        <p>
          For the iPhone app obtained from the App Store (“the App”), the following applies in
          addition to the rest of these terms. If they conflict, this section prevails for the App.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            These terms are an agreement between you and the operator, not with Apple Inc.
            (“Apple”). The operator, not Apple, is responsible for the App and its content.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator grants you a non-transferable right to use the App on Apple-branded
            products that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules in the Apple Media
            Services Terms and Conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator alone is responsible for maintenance and support of the App; Apple has no
            obligation to provide any.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple
            will refund the purchase price of the App (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by
            law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operator, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App
            (including product liability, failure to conform to legal or regulatory requirements,
            and claims under consumer protection, privacy or similar laws) and any claim that the
            App infringes a third party's intellectual property rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S.
            Government embargo or designated as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are
            not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must comply with applicable third-party terms (such as your mobile carrier's) when
            using the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these terms, and upon your
            acceptance Apple has the right to enforce them against you.
          </li>
          <li>Send questions, complaints or claims about the App to the contact in section 13.</li>
