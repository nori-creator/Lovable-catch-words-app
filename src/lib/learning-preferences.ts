Choose natural example situations related to these goals and interests when the word actually fits. Explain why and when someone would say it in that situation. Do not force an unrelated interest into a sentence, change the word's true meaning, infer personal facts, or invent extra senses. Multiple choices should influence varied examples, not all be crammed into one sentence.`;
